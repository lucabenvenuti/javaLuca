Note that the data accesses on the model interface and effected changes in the display
are caused exclusively by events of the model.
? Menus: Implement File menu and Game with menu items to exit the game and for resetting
of the game.
? Swing component for field representation and setting of the stone: Implement a separate Swing component that
the pitch is graphically. The component is derived from JPanel and override paintComponent. The
Component listens for events from the model in order to redraw the pitch at changes (repaint). The
Furthermore, the component is to allow you to set a stone. The component is intended to MouseClick events
react, and a stone on the corresponding field set (if possible).
