/**
 * Input is a utility class, providing easy to use methods to read any primitive
 * data type from the default system input, without having to deal with enhanced
 * java concepts like exceptions, streams or error handling.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Example: <blockquote>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * System.out.print(&quot;Enter number a: &quot;);
 * double a = Input.readDouble();
 * System.out.print(&quot;Enter number b: &quot;);
 * double b = Input.readDouble();
 * System.out.println(&quot;a + b = &quot; + (a + b));
 * </pre>
 * 
 * </blockquote>
 * 
 * <p>
 * There are read-Methods for the following data types: <tt>char</tt>,
 * <tt>boolean</tt>, <tt>byte</tt>, <tt>short</tt>, <tt>int</tt>,
 * <tt>long</tt>, <tt>float</tt>, <tt>double</tt>, <tt>String</tt>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Values are expected to be on separate lines: You have to press enter after
 * each value, therefore moving to the next line. If you have to read multiple
 * values from a single line, use {@link #readString()} to read a full line as
 * text, split it into several parts and convert each part into whatever data
 * type you need. Of course this is not recommended for programming beginners.
 * 
 * <p>
 * There is one additional method to read several characters from a single line:
 * {@link #readCharSequence}. This method will return character after character
 * from one line. When the end of the line is reached, '\n' is returned as a
 * line feed character (independent of the operating system), then
 * readCharSequence will continue with the next line.
 * 
 * <p>
 * All methods will automatically handle errors:
 * <ul>
 * <li>If an invalid value is entered, the user is told to enter a new, correct
 * value. (e.g., if an integer is expected and letters are entered, a message
 * like "Not a valid int, please try again" will be displayed, and the user is
 * forced to enter a new value) </li>
 * <li>If an unresolvable error is encountered (e.g., the system input stream
 * has been closed), the application is immediately terminated.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * @version 1.2, 2012-10-25

	/**
	 * Read the next character from a character sequence.
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * This method will return character after character, including a line feed
	 * character. Entering "ab" and pressing enter will produce a character
	 * sequence of <tt>'a'</tt>, <tt>'b'</tt> and <tt>'\n'</tt>. The line feed
	 * character is always <tt>'\n'</tt>, no matter which operating system is
	 * running.
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * If reading directly from System.in, the different line feed sequences of
	 * operating systems need to be taken into account:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>Any Windows: <tt>'\r'</tt> followed by <tt>'\n'</tt></li>
	 * <li>Any unix based system (e.g., Linux): <tt>'\n'</tt></li>
	 * <li>MacOS prior to MacOS X (MacOS X is unix-based): <tt>'\r'</tt></li>
	 * <li>There might be others, but it is highly unlikely you will encounter
	 * any.</li>
	 * </ul>
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * Java provides the local line feed sequence as a String in the system
	 * property <tt>line.separator</tt>. To retrieve this property, use the
	 * method <tt>System.getProperty("line.separator")</tt>.
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * Calling any other read method than readCharSequence will drop the
	 * remaining characters of the sequence.
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * The following example will read 2 characters from a character sequence,
	 * ignore any remaining characters on the line, and then read a floating
	 * point number: <blockquote>
	 * 
	 * <pre>
	 * System.out.print(&quot;Enter at least two characters: &quot;);
	 * char c1 = Input.readCharSequence();
	 * char c2 = Input.readCharSequence();
	 * System.out.print(&quot;Enter a number: &quot;);
	 * double x = Input.readDouble();
	 * </pre>
	 * 
	 * </blockquote>
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * Note: readCharSequence will wait until a full line has been entered,
	 * before returning the first character of the sequence. This is actually a
	 * limitation by Java, since the user is allowed to edit the line: the
	 * sequence may change until the enter key has been pressed.
	 * 
	 * @return A <tt>char</tt> value.
